## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   Vanilla JavaScript
*   Service Worker for PWA capabilities

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

**As a User:**

1.  Simply open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  Or, visit the [live demo link](#-live-demo) above.
3.  **To install as a PWA:**
    *   **Desktop (Chrome/Edge):** Look for an install icon in the address bar.
    *   **Mobile (Android Chrome):** You should be prompted to "Add to Home Screen" after a few interactions.
    *   **Mobile (iOS Safari):** Tap the "Share" icon, then "Add to Home Screen."

**For Local Development:**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/[YourRepositoryName].git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd [YourRepositoryName]
    ```
3.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
    *   For PWA features like the service worker to function correctly during local development, you might need to serve the files via a local web server (e.g., using the `http-server` npm package or a browser extension like "Live Server" for VS Code). `localhost` is treated as a secure origin.

## üìú How to Use

1.  **Paste Text:** Copy your script and paste it into the large text area on the setup screen.
2.  **Adjust Settings:**
    *   Use the `+` / `-` buttons or keyboard shortcuts to set the desired **Scroll Speed**.
    *   Use the `+` / `-` buttons or keyboard shortcuts to set the desired **Font Size**.
3.  **Configure Keys (Optional):** Click "Configure Keys" to customize the keyboard shortcuts for various actions. Your preferences will be saved in your browser.
4.  **Start Prompter:** Click the "Start Prompter" button.
5.  **During Playback:**
    *   Use your configured keys to play/pause, adjust speed/font, nudge the text, or exit.
    *   The red triangle on the left indicates the approximate reading line.
